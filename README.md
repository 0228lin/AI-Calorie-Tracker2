## üèóÔ∏è How to Set Up `AI-Calorie-Tracker` for Development?

This project is configured for deployment with **Vercel**. Here are the steps to set it up:

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/0228lin/AI-Calorie-Tracker2.git](https://github.com/0228lin/AI-Calorie-Tracker2.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd AI-Calorie-Tracker
    ```

3.  **Install Vercel Function dependencies**
    Navigate into the `api` directory and install its dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd api
    npm install
    cd .. # Go back to the root directory
    ```

4.  **Create a `.env` file for local development**
    In the **root** of your project, create a file named `.env` and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    **Remember: Do NOT commit this `.env` file to your public GitHub repository! It's already in `.gitignore`.**

5.  **Run locally (optional, requires Vercel CLI)**
    * Install Vercel CLI globally if you haven't already: `npm install -g vercel`
    * From the **root** of your project, run: `vercel dev`
    * This will start a local development server, and your API functions will be available.

## üöÄ How to Deploy to Vercel

1.  **Push your code to GitHub:** Ensure your project, with the structure and files (including `vercel.json` and the `api` folder) are pushed to a GitHub repository.

2.  **Sign up or Log in to Vercel:** Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and sign in. You can sign up directly with your GitHub account for easy integration.

3.  **Import Your Project:**
    * On your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New..." then "Project".
    * Choose "Import Git Repository" and select your `AI-Calorie-Tracker` repository from GitHub.

4.  **Configure Project Settings:**
    * Vercel will usually auto-detect your project settings.
    * Ensure the **Root Directory** is set to `/` (the root of your repository).
    * Under **"Framework Preset"** (in the "Build & Development Settings"), select **"Other"**.
    * For **"Output Directory,"** **set this to `.`** (a single dot). This tells Vercel that your `index.html` is directly in the root of the project.

5.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    * Before deploying, go to the "Environment Variables" section in your Vercel project settings.
    * Add a new environment variable:
        * **Name:** `GEMINI_API_KEY`
        * **Value:** Paste your actual Gemini API key here.
    * Make sure this variable is configured for the "Production" and "Preview" environments.

6.  **Deploy:** Click the "Deploy" button. Vercel will build and deploy your static site and serverless functions.

7.  **Access Your Demo:** Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a unique URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`). **This is the URL you should share with your users for the live demo.** It will be fully functional, with the API key securely handled by the Vercel serverless function.
